# bold-hour with dates, day and battery status

This is based on yanatan16's pebble-bold-hour project (https://github.com/yanatan16/pebble-bold-hour) with following features:

1. slightly modified digit images for 2, 3, 5 and 12
2. display of dates and day
3. indication of battery status including charging state

Note that these features are only applicable on the white-text version at the moment.
